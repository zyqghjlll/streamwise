# 📘 StreamWise: Intelligent Stream Data Platform

> A dual-stream data pipeline for real-time and delayed processing. Suitable for industrial monitoring, AI data preparation, and event-driven applications.

---

## 🚀 Overview
**StreamWise** is an extensible, high-throughput stream processing platform that collects, processes, and stores data from edge devices, applications, and logging systems.

Supports:
- 📡 Real-time stream processing (e.g., industrial alerts)
- 🔄 Delayed stream for batch processing and AI training
- ⚙️ Kafka-based data ingestion
- 📊 Redis/PostgreSQL storage for visualization or further analysis
- 🧠 Structured data output for building domain-specific large language models (LLMs)

## 📦 Tech Stack
| Layer        | Technology         |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Data Ingestion | Kafka              |
| Processing     | Spring Boot / Flink (future) |
| Caching        | Redis              |
| Storage        | PostgreSQL         |
| Deployment     | Docker / Kubernetes |
| Monitoring     | Prometheus / Grafana |

## 🔧 Features
- ✅ Dual-path design: real-time (alerts) + delayed (AI/data lake)
- ✅ Modular architecture: plug-and-play processing and protocol layers
- ✅ Scalable from laptop to cloud: deploy via Docker or Kubernetes
- ✅ Supports both personal and enterprise-grade deployment
- ✅ Prepares structured data as knowledge corpus for training industry-specific LLMs

## 🧪 Use Cases
- 🚨 Industrial equipment monitoring and alerting
- 📈 Log processing and anomaly detection
- 🧠 AI model data preparation
- 🏭 Building domain-specific knowledge base for LLM training

---

## 🎯 Roadmap
- [x] Phase 1: Kafka → Redis → PostgreSQL
- [ ] Phase 2: Integrate Flink for delayed stream processing
- [ ] Phase 3: Add alerting engine + rule configuration
- [ ] Phase 4: Prepare labeled data for AI model training
- [ ] Phase 5: Build pipelines to feed industry-specific LLMs
